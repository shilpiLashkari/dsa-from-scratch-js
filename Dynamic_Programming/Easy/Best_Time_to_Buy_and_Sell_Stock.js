// Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
// You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
// You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
// Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

// Example 1:
// Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
// Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

// Example 2:
// Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

// Constraints:
// 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
// 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
    let minPrice = Infinity;
    let maxProfit = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i] < minPrice) {
            minPrice = prices[i];
        } else if (prices[i] - minPrice > maxProfit) {
            maxProfit = prices[i] - minPrice;
        }
    }

    return maxProfit;
};

// Notes:
// - We use a single-pass greedy approach. 
// - Iterate through the array once, keeping track of the minimum price encountered so far.
// - Calculate the potential profit at each day by subtracting the minimum price from the current price.
// - Update the maximum profit if the current potential profit is greater.
// - Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the length of the prices array.
// - Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use a few variables for tracking values.
