/**
 * Problem: Container With Most Water
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Pattern: Two Pointers / Greedy
 * 
 * You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
 * Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 * Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
 * Notice that you may not slant the container.
 * 
 * Complexity:
 * - Time: O(N) where N is the length of the height array. Two pointers traverse the array once.
 * - Space: O(1) as we use constant extra space.
